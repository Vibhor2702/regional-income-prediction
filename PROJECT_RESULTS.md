### Machine Learning Pipeline Complete ✅

#### 1. Data Processing
- ✅ Loaded real IRS tax data from `15zpallagi.csv` (172 MB file)
- ✅ Parsed IRS variable codes and aggregated by ZIP code
- ✅ Generated synthetic Census features (demographics, education, housing)
- ✅ Created 26 feature variables for modeling
- ✅ Saved processed dataset as Parquet format (5.94 MB)

#### 2. Model Training
Trained 4 different machine learning models:

| Model              | MAE      | RMSE      | R² Score |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **XGBoost** 🏆     | $3,591   | $10,923   | **0.9455** |
| Random Forest      | $2,615   | $12,232   | 0.9316   |
| LightGBM           | $5,555   | $12,989   | 0.9229   |
| Linear Regression  | $16,704  | $34,044   | 0.4703   |
